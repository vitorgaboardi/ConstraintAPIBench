Our API allows you to make a simple GET request, passing in the URL of a sitemap.xml file as a parameter. The API will handle the rest, downloading the file, parsing it into a JSON object, and returning the result in the response. And if you need a little extra information to help organize and navigate the URLs in the sitemap, we've got you covered there too. By adding a query parameter to the GET request, you can also include category and breadcrumb information for each URL in the parsed sitemap. Give it a try and see how much easier working with sitemaps can be!",
