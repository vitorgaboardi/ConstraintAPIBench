            "description": "**Advanced Endpoint: Comprehensive Lunar and Solar Details**\n\nUnlock comprehensive insights into the lunar and solar aspects with the Advanced Endpoint. This endpoint delivers an extensive JSON object filled with detailed information about the moon, including its phase, illumination percentage, age in days since the last new moon, lunar cycle completion percentage, current phase name, moon-rise and moon set times, zodiac/star sign association, and much more. Additionally, it provides sun-related data such as sunrise and sunset times, solar noon, day length, and solar positions. Dive deep into lunar and solar analytics with this endpoint to enhance your understanding of the moon's dynamics.\n\n**Filter Data in Advanced Moon API**\n\nThe Advanced Moon API allows users to filter the returned data based on their specific requirements. By including the `filters` parameter in the API request, users can customise the data fields they want to retrieve. The `filters` parameter accepts a comma-separated list of keys representing the desired data fields.\n\n**Example Usage**\n\n**Request**\n\n```\nGET /advanced?filters=moon.phase_name,moon.stage,moon_phases.full_moon.next\n```\n\nThis example request filters the data to include only the moon's phase name, stage, and the next full moon information.\n\n**Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"moon\": {\n    \"phase_name\": \"First Quarter\",\n    \"stage\": \"waxing\",\n    \"moon_phases\": {\n      \"full_moon\": {\n        \"next\": {\n          \"timestamp\": 1671379200,\n          \"datestamp\": \"2023-01-17T00:00:00+00:00\",\n          \"days_ahead\": 258,\n          \"name\": \"Wolf Moon\",\n          \"description\": \"Named after the howling wolves often heard during this time.\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the response, only the filtered data fields are included.\n\n**Additional Filter Examples**\n\n- Filter only the moon's phase name and age in days:\n\n  ```\n  GET /advanced?filters=moon.phase_name,moon.age_days\n  ```\n\n- Filter the moon's phase name and the sunrise time:\n\n  ```\n  GET /advanced?filters=moon.phase_name,sun.sunrise_timestamp\n  ```\n\n- Filter the moon's phase name and the next new moon date:\n\n  ```\n  GET /advanced?filters=moon.phase_name,moon_phases.new_moon.next.datestamp\n  ```\n\nUsers can customise the filters according to their specific requirements to retrieve the desired data fields.",
