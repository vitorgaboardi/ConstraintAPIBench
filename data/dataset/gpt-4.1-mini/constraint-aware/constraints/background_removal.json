In this case the result is a single-channel grayscale PNG image.\n    * Areas recognized as foreground will have white color.\n    * Areas recognized as background will be black at output image.\n    * Pixels of output image near to foreground borders may have gray values: the closer\n     to black, the more likely the pixel is the background.\n* `fg-image-shadow` \u2013 the image with the foreground object and realistic shadow below.
