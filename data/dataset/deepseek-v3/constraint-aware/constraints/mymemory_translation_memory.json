MyMemory will check if a sentence has been already translated in the private TM specified. If we don't find it in the private TM of the translator, we search it in the public TMs (shared among all the translators). Again, if we don't have this translation we ask MT providers to generate it.  In order to get the best from MyMemory, it is highly recommended to use different keys for each translators and also different keys for different topics (as a real Translation Memory).",
